#[Heritage Education Services Program](http://www.nps.gov/history/hes.htm) Data Repository for Travel Itinerary Series

The Heritage Education Services Program of the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov) is responsible for administering the [Teaching with Historic Places](http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/) program with its series of on-line lesson plan series and the [Discover Our Shared Heritage](http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/) travel itineraries. As our list of travel itineraries grows, the historic destinations you can visit online or in person are virtually endless! Each itinerary is a self-guided tour to historic places most of which are listed in the [National Register of Historic Places](http://www.nps.gov/nr/). Spotlighting different communities, geographic regions and themes across the country, the travel itineraries expose you to a huge variety of places significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. The Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itineraries can help you plan your next trip!

This repository was created to serve the data being used in the Travel Itinerary Series.  It is continuously updated as new itineraries come out.
